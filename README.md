# Pac-Man
PacMen will appear in different sizes and shapes once the create pacman button is clicked. PacMen will bounce off the borders and switch directions after this. 

## Implementation
	1.	Fork a Copy of this project to your Github page
	2.	Clone a copy from your Github page to your local work environment
	3.	Open the index file using a browser
	4.	Using the button, add one or more Pacman to the game board with each click
	5.	Using the button, start the game 
  
## Future Improvements 
  I'd like to add more pacmen characters, such as the pacman ghost and a lady pacman. 
  Syle the game to look closer to the arcade pacman game.
